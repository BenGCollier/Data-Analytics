# Data Analytics: Skills & Knowledge Assessment

## Strengths
- Out of the four core areas, Data Analytics is the one I have the most knowledge and experience in.
- I can create and interpret most predictive models efficiently. 
- RapidMiner as a tool has become very easy for me to use and navigate through.
- I feel comfortable using Power BI even though I do not have as much experience with it compared to tools like RapidMiner or Excel.
- Areas in which Excel was needed came easy to me.

## Weaknesses
- Tableau is still relatively new to me, I did not get all that much experience with it.
- Struggled with some aspects of Microsoft Azure.
- I am prone to making mistakes when cleaning data.

## Wants/Wishes
- I would like to have a deeper understanding of certain models like Neural Networks.
- I wish I got the chance to use Power BI in classes other than CIDM 5310.
