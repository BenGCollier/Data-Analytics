# Data Analytics: Skills & Knowledge Assessment

## Strengths
- Out of the four core areas, data analytics is the one I have the most knowledge and experience in.
- I can create and interpret most predictive models efficiently. 
- RapidMiner as a tool has become very easy for me to use and navigate through.
- I feel comfortable using Power BI even though I do not have as much experience with it compared to tools like RapidMiner or Excel.
- Areas in which Excel was needed came easy to me.

## Weaknesses
- Tableau is still relatively new to me, I did not get all that much experience with it.
- Struggled with some aspects of Microsoft Azure.
- Struggled with cleaning data for CIDM 5310.

## Wants/Wishes
- I would like to have a deeper understanding of certain models like Neural Networks.
- I wish I got the chance to use Power BI in classes other than CIDM 5310.

## Knowledge Sources
- Lecture slides
- Lecture/instructional videos
- Course lectures
- Course textbook
- DataCamp
- Searching the web

## Summary Statement
- With the skills I have learned and tools I have used in both CIDM 5310 and 6308, using them in future settings will be highly likely. 50,000+ companies use either Tableau or Power BI as an analytics tool, and many large companies use RapidMiner, so

# Data Analytics: Integration

## Why Data Analytics is Integrable with Other Areas
- Data mining and management involves extracting valuable information from datasets, while data analytics takes that information 
- Systems development
- Networking and cybersecurity

## How Data Analytics is Integrable with Other Areas

## How Data Analytics is Integrable with Prior Work
- In both CIDM 5310 and 6308, cleaning data was needed for almost all of the assignments, which is a big part of data mining and management.
