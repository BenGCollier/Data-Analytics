# Data Analytics: Skills & Knowledge Assessment

## Strengths
- Out of the four core areas, data analytics is the one I have the most knowledge and experience in.
- I can create and interpret most predictive models efficiently. 
- RapidMiner as a tool has become very easy for me to use and navigate through.
- I feel comfortable using Power BI even though I do not have as much experience with it compared to tools like RapidMiner or Excel.
- Areas in which Excel was needed came easy to me.

## Weaknesses
- Tableau is still relatively new to me, I did not get all that much experience with it.
- Struggled with some aspects of Microsoft Azure.
- Struggled with cleaning data for CIDM 5310.

## Wants/Wishes
- I would like to have a deeper understanding of certain models like Neural Networks.
- I wish I got the chance to use Power BI in classes other than CIDM 5310.

## Summary
Data analytics is a rapidly growing field with widespread industry adoption. Over 50,000 companies use tools like Power BI and Tableau, while RapidMiner is utilized by major enterprises for advanced analytics. My exposure to these tools provides a solid foundation for future career applications. As organizations continue leveraging data for decision-making, my competencies in predictive modeling, data mining, and visualization will be highly relevant.

# Data Analytics: Integration

## Why and How Data Analytics is Integrable with Other Areas
- Data mining involves extracting valuable information from datasets, while data analytics takes that information and ensures that it is meaningful. Data management on the other hand makes sure data is stored in a manner that can be used in data analytics and decision-making.
- Systems development is aided by data analytics as it allows software engineers and developers to optimize system performance through analyzing user behavior and system efficiency. Additionally, predictive models can be used to detect potential system failures before they occur.
- Networking and cybersecurity makes use of data analytics through analyzing network traffic patterns to detect any anomalies and cyber security threats. Organizations can also improve their cybersecurity strategies by analyzing past attacks and/or security breaches.

## How Data Analytics is Integrable with Prior Work
- In both CIDM 5310 and 6308, data mining and data management played a crucial role in projects. Many assignments required cleaning and structuring raw data before applying analytics techniques.

## Integration Statement
Data analytics serves as the backbone of modern technology by transforming raw data into actionable insights. Whether in data mining and management, systems development, or networking and cybersecurity, analytics enables informed decision-making, enhances efficiency, and strengthens security.

## Preparedness
Given my background in predictive modeling, data mining, and visualization tools, I am well-prepared to integrate data analytics into my capstone project. Whether through Power BI dashboards, machine learning models, or data-driven security analysis, I can apply my skills to create impactful solutions. My work samples, coupled with my continued learning in advanced analytics concepts and tools, will allow me to develop a comprehensive portfolio that showcases my expertise in data analytics.
