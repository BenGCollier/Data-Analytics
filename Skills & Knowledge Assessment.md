# Data Analytics: Skills & Knowledge Assessment

## Strengths
- Out of the four core areas, data analytics is the one I have the most knowledge and experience in.
- I can create and interpret most predictive models efficiently. 
- RapidMiner as a tool has become very easy for me to use and navigate through.
- I feel comfortable using Power BI even though I do not have as much experience with it compared to tools like RapidMiner or Excel.

## Wants/Wishes
- I would like to have a deeper understanding of certain models like Neural Networks.
- I wish I got the chance to use Power BI in classes other than CIDM 5310.

Not to mention, the field of data analytics is a 

# Data Analytics: Integration

## Why and How Data Analytics is Integrable with Other Areas
- Data mining involves extracting valuable information from datasets, while data analytics takes that information and ensures that it is meaningful. Data management on the other hand makes sure data is stored in a manner that can be used in data analytics and decision-making.
- Systems development
- Networking and cybersecurity

## How Data Analytics is Integrable with Prior Work
- In both CIDM 5310 and 6308, data mining and
